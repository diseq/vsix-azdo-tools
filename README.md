## Features

### üîê Secure Authentication
- **Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)** integration for secure Azure DevOps authentication
- Uses VS Code's secure secret storage for token management
- Supports the same authentication flow as other Microsoft VS Code extensions
- Device code flow for secure authentication without embedded browser

### üõ†Ô∏è Chat Tools Integration
- **Azure DevOps Login**: Authenticate with Azure DevOps from the chat interface
- **List Projects**: Get all projects in your organization
- **Work Items**: View and create work items (bugs, tasks, user stories, etc.)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Commands
- `Azure DevOps: Set Organization` - Configure your Azure DevOps organization URL
- `Azure DevOps: Sign In` - Authenticate with Azure DevOps
- `Azure DevOps: Sign Out` - Sign out and clear stored credentials
- `Azure DevOps: Test Connection` - Test your connection to Azure DevOps
- `Azure DevOps: Show Status` - View current authentication and connection status
- `Azure DevOps: Toggle Readonly Mode` - Enable/disable readonly mode to prevent write operations

### üîí Readonly Mode
The extension includes a **readonly mode** feature that provides a safe way to browse Azure DevOps data without risking accidental modifications.

When readonly mode is enabled:
- All write operations are blocked (create, update, delete work items and comments)
- View and read operations continue to work normally
- Clear warnings are shown when attempting write operations
- The status is displayed in the "Azure DevOps: Show Status" command

**Usage:**
- Use `Azure DevOps: Toggle Readonly Mode` command to enable/disable
- Configure the default setting in VS Code settings: `azureDevOpsTools.readonly`
- Perfect for demo environments, production troubleshooting, or when you want to explore data safely

**Protected Operations:**
- Creating work items (individual, batch, tree structures)
- Updating work items 
- Deleting work items
- Adding, updating, or deleting work item comments
- Reverting work items to previous revisions

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the Extension
Install the extension from the VSIX file or VS Code marketplace.

### 2. Configure Your Organization
1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run `Azure DevOps: Set Organization`
3. Enter your Azure DevOps organization URL:
   - `https://dev.azure.com/yourorganization`
   - or `https://yourorganization.visualstudio.com`

### 3. Sign In
1. Run `Azure DevOps: Sign In` from the Command Palette
2. Follow the device code authentication flow:
   - A notification will show with a URL and code
   - Click "Open Browser" to open the authentication page
   - Enter the provided code and complete the sign-in process

### 4. Use Chat Tools
Once authenticated, you can use the Azure DevOps tools in VS Code Chat:

```
@workspace #azure-devops_login
@workspace #azure-devops_projects
@workspace #azure-devops_workitems projectName:"MyProject"
@workspace #azure-devops_create-workitem projectName:"MyProject" workItemType:"Task" title:"New task"
```

## Security Features

### Token Management
- Tokens are stored securely using VS Code's `SecretStorage` API
- Automatic token refresh when expired
- Secure token cleanup on sign-out

### Authentication Flow
- Uses Microsoft's recommended device code flow for desktop applications
- Same authentication mechanism as other Microsoft VS Code extensions
- No embedded browsers or insecure token handling

### API Security
- Proper base64 encoding of tokens for Azure DevOps API
- HTTPS-only communication
- Follows Azure DevOps REST API security best practices

## Installation

```bash
code --install-extension adzo-tools-0.1.0.vsix
```

## Authentication Details

This extension uses the same authentication approach as other Microsoft VS Code extensions:

- **Client ID**: `872cd9fa-d31f-45e0-9eab-6e460a02d1f1` (Visual Studio client ID)
- **Scope**: `499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798/.default` (Azure DevOps scope)
- **Flow**: Device Code Flow for secure desktop authentication
- **Token Storage**: VS Code SecretStorage API

## Troubleshooting

### Chat Tools Not Working
If Copilot says it cannot execute Azure DevOps tools like `#azure-devops_create-workitem`:

1. **Check Extension Installation**: Ensure the extension is properly installed and activated
   ```bash
   code --install-extension basic-mcp-extension-0.1.0.vsix
   ```

2. **Reload VS Code**: After installation, reload the window
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Run `Developer: Reload Window`

3. **Check Authentication**: Make sure you're signed in
   ```
   @workspace #azure-devops_login
   ```

4. **Verify Organization**: Ensure your organization URL is set
   - Run `Azure DevOps: Show Status` from Command Palette
   - Or set it with `Azure DevOps: Set Organization`

5. **Test Basic Connectivity**: Try simpler tools first
   ```
   @workspace #azure-devops_projects
   ```

### Authentication Issues
1. Run `Azure DevOps: Show Status` to check your authentication status
2. Try `Azure DevOps: Sign Out` and sign in again
3. Ensure your organization URL is correct

### Connection Issues
1. Run `Azure DevOps: Test Connection` to verify connectivity
2. Check that you have access to the Azure DevOps organization
3. Verify your network connection and proxy settings
